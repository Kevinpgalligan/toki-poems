## Description
Poem generation for the toki pona language.

[Write-up here](https://kevingal.com/blog/toki-poetry.html).

## Possible improvements
1. Pass last word in line as state to next line so that there's continuity.
2. Try to end a line with a word that has at least one rhyme buddy (if that line needs to match with another one, that is).
3. I had another idea. Can't remember.
